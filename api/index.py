"""
Vercel entrypoint.

Vercel's Python runtime auto-discovers `api/index.py` and serves the
top-level `app` as a single Fluid function receiving every path -- so `/mcp`,
`/health` and `/metrics` all land in this one module. No rewrites are needed
in vercel.json.

Why a FastAPI wrapper instead of exporting the FastMCP app directly
-------------------------------------------------------------------
FastMCP's streamable-HTTP transport initialises its session manager in an
ASGI *lifespan* startup event. If the host never runs lifespan, every request
to /mcp fails with "Task group is not initialized" -- a total outage of the
MCP endpoint, verified locally by driving the app without lifespan.

Vercel's lifespan support (shipped 2025-12-09) is announced specifically for
"FastAPI apps". Whether that means FastAPI or any ASGI app is not stated.
Rather than bet the whole endpoint on that ambiguity, this wraps the FastMCP
app in FastAPI and hands over its lifespan -- which is also exactly the
integration FastMCP documents as required when mounting into a parent ASGI
app. Costs one dependency; removes a total-failure mode.

Two other deliberate choices:

* `stateless_http=True` -- serverless invocations are short-lived and are not
  guaranteed to land on the same instance, so there is nowhere to keep a
  session. Vercel's own guidance for remote MCP is the stateless
  streamable-HTTP model, and FastMCP notes most clients (Cursor, Claude Code)
  use `fetch()` internally and never forward `Set-Cookie` anyway.

* `json_response` left off -- buffering the whole response as JSON
  re-acquires Vercel's 4.5 MB body cap, and a 15-way flight fan-out is not
  comfortably under it. Streaming responses are exempt from that limit.

The canonical MCP path is `/mcp` with NO trailing slash. `/mcp/` answers via
a 307, but MCP_PUBLIC_URL must be the exact URL clients use, and Lulu hashes
it into Claude's widget domain -- so a stray slash there costs all the CPM.
