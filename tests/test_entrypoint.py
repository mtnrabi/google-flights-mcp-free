"""
The Vercel entrypoint, driven the way a host drives it: raw ASGI.

`api/index.py` exists for one reason -- to hand FastMCP's lifespan to
whatever runs the app -- and that reason is invisible to every other test in
this suite, because `fastmcp.Client` sets the session up itself. So this file
drives the exported `app` over ASGI directly and asserts both halves:

* with the lifespan run, POST /mcp `initialize` answers with a serverInfo;
* with it skipped, the same request fails.

The second assertion is the point. It is what makes a future "the wrapper
looks redundant, let's export the FastMCP app directly" change fail here
instead of in production, where it presents as every /mcp request returning
500 "Task group is not initialized" under a green Vercel dashboard.

The wrapper is a Starlette app rather than a FastAPI one because importing
FastAPI costs ~110 ms of CPU on every cold start and this app publishes no
OpenAPI schema. Nothing here asserts the class: what matters is that the
lifespan runs and /mcp answers, which is true of either.
