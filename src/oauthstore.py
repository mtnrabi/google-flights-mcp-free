"""
Durable storage for the MCP-protocol OAuth flow: clients, codes, tokens.

PROVENANCE. A copy of `mcp_server_paid/src/oauthstore.py`, changed in exactly
two ways: the tables are `free_mcp_oauth_*` instead of `mcp_oauth_*`, and
`keystore` is not imported because this server has no key store. Copied rather
than shared for the reason given in `src/oauth.py`'s header (two Vercel
projects, two uploads, no common parent in either bundle).

Separate TABLES, not just a separate prefix, and that is the point: a token
minted by the free, ad-carrying server must never be a token the paid server
would accept, and the cheapest way to guarantee that is for neither to be able
to read the other's rows at all. The `resource` audience check would also
catch it; two mechanisms for the one property that keeps ad revenue and paid
revenue apart is the right number (rule 5).

Why this file exists at all
---------------------------
Day 1 (`/connect`) needed no server-side state: the session cookie and the
`fpk_` connect token are both self-contained signed payloads, so any instance
can verify one without having seen it issued. MCP-protocol OAuth cannot work
that way, and the reason is worth writing down because it is the exact
blocker that kept the flow out of day 1:

* **Dynamically-registered clients must be remembered.** A client registers,
  then seconds later calls /authorize. On Vercel those are two different
  instances. `OAuthProxy`'s default client store is process memory, so the
  second instance answers "unknown client_id" -- correct code, wrong storage.
* **Authorization codes must be single-use.** "Single use" is a claim about a
  row being consumed, which needs somewhere that two concurrent requests
  agree about. A signed, self-contained code cannot be burned.
* **Access and refresh tokens must be revocable.** A signed token is valid
  until it expires, whatever we later decide about it. RFC 7009 revocation,
  and "Disconnect logs every client out", both need a row to delete.

So: Neon Postgres, the same database day 1 uses, reached the same way --
asyncpg imported lazily inside the first call that touches it, one connection
per operation, pointed at the POOLED endpoint. Tables in
`migrations/002_mcp_oauth.sql`.

What is stored, and what is not
-------------------------------
Codes, access tokens, refresh tokens and client secrets are stored as
**SHA-256 hashes, never in the clear**. A database dump therefore contains
nothing that can be replayed. Plain SHA-256 rather than an HMAC under a
pepper because every one of these values is 32 bytes from `os.urandom`: there
is no dictionary to attack and a pepper would only add a second secret to
rotate.

A row holds the Google `sub` that authorised it -- the same identity day 1's
`mcp_user_keys` is keyed by, which is what lets an OAuth-authenticated tool
call find the user's stored RapidAPI key without a second sign-in. It never
holds a RapidAPI key; that stays in `mcp_user_keys`, encrypted.
