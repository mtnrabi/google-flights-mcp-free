"""
Promote the `Args:` docstring block into the JSON Schema a reviewer reads.

Every tool in this package already documents its parameters in a Google-style
`Args:` block. FastMCP does not read those blocks -- it builds `inputSchema`
from type hints alone -- so until this module was applied here the free server
advertised 48 of its 50 parameters with a type and no description, while the
descriptions sat in the source two lines above. (The two exceptions were the
`use_fallback` flags, which carry an explicit `Annotated[..., Field(...)]`.)

This file is a copy of `mcp_server_paid/src/schema_docs.py`. The two packages
are separate Vercel deployments with no shared import path -- `fanout.py`,
`output_schema.py`, `stores.py` and `telemetry.py` are duplicated the same way
-- so a fix to the parser belongs in both copies. Keep them byte-comparable
below this docstring.

That is not a cosmetic gap. Anthropic's review criteria and OpenAI's plugin
guidelines both judge whether a model can call a tool correctly from its
schema alone, and OpenAI lists missing or unclear tool metadata as a common
rejection cause. A bare `{"type": "integer"}` for `seat_type` tells a model
nothing; "1 economy, 2 premium economy, 3 business, 4 first" tells it
everything.

The fix keeps the docstring as the single source of truth rather than
duplicating every sentence into a `Field(description=...)`: `document_params`
parses the block and rewrites the function's annotations to
`Annotated[T, Field(description=...)]` *before* FastMCP inspects them. Applied
as the inner decorator:

    @mcp.tool(name="...", ...)
    @document_params
    async def search_oneway_flights(...):

Decorators run bottom-up, so the annotations are already carrying their
descriptions by the time `mcp.tool` builds the schema.

Two deliberate limits. A parameter already annotated `Annotated[...]` is left
alone, because a second `Field()` in one `Annotated` is a pydantic error rather
than a merge. And a docstring with no `Args:` block is not an error -- the
function is returned untouched -- so this can be applied uniformly without
forcing a docstring onto every helper.
